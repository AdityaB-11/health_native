### 2. **Replaced Mock Data with Firestore** 📊

Updated `src/api/services.ts` to use real Firebase services:

#### Before (Mock Data):
```typescript
const USE_MOCK_DATA = true;

export const getDoctors = async () => {
  if (USE_MOCK_DATA) {
    return mockDoctors; // Fake data
  }
  // API call
};
```

#### After (Firebase):
```typescript
import { getDoctors as getFirebaseDoctors } from './firebaseServices';

export const getDoctors = async () => {
  try {
    return await getFirebaseDoctors(); // Real Firestore data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching doctors:', error);
    return [];
  }
};
```

**All services now use Firestore:**
- ✅ `getDoctors()` → Firestore doctors collection
- ✅ `getDoctorById(id)` → Firestore doctor document
- ✅ `getPatients()` → Firestore patients collection
- ✅ `getMedicines()` → Firestore medicines collection
- ✅ `getArticles()` → Firestore articles collection
- ✅ `getLabReports(patientId?)` → Firestore labReports collection (with optional filtering)
- ✅ `addDoctor()`, `addMedicine()`, `addArticle()` → Add to Firestore
- ✅ `uploadLabReport()` → Add to Firestore

**Error Handling:**
- All functions wrapped in try-catch
- Return empty arrays on error (graceful degradation)
- Proper error logging
