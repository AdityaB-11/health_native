```
Dashboard
├── DoctorAppointmentsScreen → AppointmentDetail
├── DoctorPatientsScreen → DoctorPatientDetailScreen
├── DoctorReportsScreen (Lab Reports)
└── DoctorProfile

Patients Tab
└── DoctorPatientDetailScreen
    ├── Appointment History
    └── Lab Reports
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Database
Run the initialization script to create sample data:
```bash
node scripts/initFirebase.js
```

This creates:
- 3 user accounts (admin, doctor, patient)
- 5 doctors
- 3 patients
- 7+ appointments
- Lab reports

### Step 2: Link Doctor Account
After initialization, you need to manually link the doctor user to a doctor profile:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Find the doctor@health.com user, copy UID
3. Go to Firestore → users collection
4. Find the doctor user document
5. Add field: `doctorId` = `[first doctor ID from doctors collection]`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "uid": "abc123xyz",
  "email": "doctor@health.com",
  "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "role": "doctor",
  "doctorId": "[paste doctor document ID here]"
}
```

### Step 3: Login as Doctor
```
Email: doctor@health.com
Password: password
```
