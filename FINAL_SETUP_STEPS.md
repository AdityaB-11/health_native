# 🚀 Final Setup Steps for Doctor Portal

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. ✅ Firebase database initialized with sample data:
   - 5 Doctors (including Dr. Sarah Johnson - ID: zpQnJsAc8oe3IrxupvGP)
   - 3 Patients  
   - 7 Appointments (today, tomorrow, past, future)
   - 6 Medicines
   - 3 Articles
   - 3 Lab Reports

2. ✅ All code files created and updated

## ⚠️ What Needs Manual Setup

### Step 1: Enable Email/Password Authentication

The users couldn't be created because Email/Password authentication isn't enabled yet.

**Do this:**
1. Open Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/health-manage01/authentication
2. Click on **"Sign-in method"** tab
3. Find **"Email/Password"** in the list
4. Click it and toggle **"Enable"**
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Create Users Manually

Once Email/Password is enabled, run the script again:

```bash
node scripts/initFirebase.js
```

Or create users manually in Firebase Console → Authentication → Users:

**Admin User:**
- Email: `admin@health.com`
- Password: `password`

**Doctor User:**
- Email: `doctor@health.com`
- Password: `password`

**Patient User:**
- Email: `patient@health.com`
- Password: `password`

### Step 3: Create User Documents in Firestore

After creating users in Authentication, create corresponding documents:

**For each user in Firebase Console → Firestore → users collection:**

1. **admin@health.com** (copy UID from Authentication):
```json
{
  "uid": "[paste UID from Authentication]",
  "email": "admin@health.com",
  "name": "Admin User",
  "role": "admin",
  "createdAt": [auto-generate timestamp]
}
```

2. **doctor@health.com** (copy UID from Authentication):
```json
{
  "uid": "[paste UID from Authentication]",
  "email": "doctor@health.com",
  "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "role": "doctor",
  "doctorId": "zpQnJsAc8oe3IrxupvGP",
  "createdAt": [auto-generate timestamp]
}
```
**Important:** Use the doctor ID: `zpQnJsAc8oe3IrxupvGP` (Dr. Sarah Johnson)

3. **patient@health.com** (copy UID from Authentication):
```json
{
  "uid": "[paste UID from Authentication]",
  "email": "patient@health.com",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "role": "patient",
  "createdAt": [auto-generate timestamp]
}
```

### Step 4: Update Firestore Security Rules

The database is in test mode (public access). Deploy production rules:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/health-manage01/firestore/rules
2. Replace all rules with the content from `firestore.rules` file
3. Click **"Publish"**
